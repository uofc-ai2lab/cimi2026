    <h2>About CIMI 2025</h2>
    <p>
      The Workshop on Computational Intelligence for Medical Imaging (CIMI 2025) brings together researchers, trainees, and professionals working at the intersection of AI and medical image analysis. The workshop will feature invited talks, methodological discussions, and a hands-on MRI classification challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants will explore the entire workflow—from data acquisition and preprocessing to model development, validation, and interpretability.
